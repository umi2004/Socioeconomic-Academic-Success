How Family Background And Resources Affect Academic Success

This project explores how socioeconomic factors, including parental education, occupation, and access to resources, influence the academic performance of undergraduate engineering students. Using linear regression and data from Colombian students, the study identifies key predictors and quantifies their impact. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory visualization, assumption testing, model refinement, and hypothesis testing to provide actionable insights into educational disparities. Findings aim to support evidence-based programs that address these disparities and improve academic outcomes for underprivileged students.
